In this note, we provide numerical evidence that quantum sensors are only efficient in a certain window of time. In particular, we sensed an external magnetic field $bold(B)$ coupled to the quantum Ising model. Our sensor achieves a quantum advantage within a certain window of time; outside of this window, the sensor can not extract additional information about the external field parameters.
